   A.Segment Tree Explanation (Sum on a Segment)
   ------------------------------------------

   A Segment Tree is a data structure that allows us to efficiently perform 
   range-based queries and updates on an array. It is especially useful for problems 
   like finding the sum of elements in a given range and updating elements at 
   specific indices.

   The basic idea behind a segment tree is to build a binary tree where each node 
   represents the sum of a segment (range) of the array. By doing so, we can answer 
   range queries and apply updates in logarithmic time.

   Example:
   Let's consider the following array:

   Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
   Index:  0  1  2  3  4  5

   Visual Representation of the Segment Tree:
   
                              [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] => Sum = 36
                             /                     \
               [1, 3, 5] => Sum = 9          [7, 9, 11] => Sum = 27
               /          \                      /           \
        [1, 3] => Sum = 4   [5] => Sum = 5  [7, 9] => Sum = 16   [11] => Sum = 11
         /   \                               /   \
     [1]     [3]                        [7]       [9]

   The leaf nodes represent the individual elements of the array. Each internal 
   node contains the sum of its two children, representing the sum over a segment 
   of the array.

   How Queries Work:
   -----------------
   Suppose we want to find the sum of elements from index 1 to 4 (inclusive of 1, 
   exclusive of 4) in the array [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]. This range corresponds to 
   [3, 5, 7] in the array. Let's see how the segment tree helps:

   1. The query asks for the sum of the range [1, 4), i.e., indices 1, 2, 3.
   2. We begin at the root node, which covers the entire array. Since the query 
      only partially overlaps with this node's range, we need to check both children.
   3. For the left child (range [0, 2]), only part of this range overlaps with 
      the query range. We need to go deeper.
   4. For the right child (range [3, 5]), the query completely overlaps with 
      the left part (range [3, 4]). We can take its value directly.
   5. The result is the sum of the overlapping parts, which is 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

   Updates in Segment Tree:
   ------------------------
   When we want to update an element in the array (for example, change the value at 
   index 2 from 5 to 6), we need to propagate this change up the tree.

   Steps:
   1. Update the leaf node corresponding to index 2.
   2. Recalculate the sum at each internal node that is affected by the change.
   3. The update is complete after propagating the change up to the root.

   Time Complexity:
   ----------------
   Both the query and update operations take O(log n) time, where n is the size of 
   the array. This is because the height of the segment tree is log n, and we 
   traverse only one path from the root to a leaf for updates and queries.

   Example for Update:
   -------------------
   Array before update: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
   Update: set a[2] = 6

   Segment Tree before update:
                              [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11] => Sum = 36
                             /                     \
               [1, 3, 5] => Sum = 9          [7, 9, 11] => Sum = 27
               /          \                      /           \
        [1, 3] => Sum = 4   [5] => Sum = 5  [7, 9] => Sum = 16   [11] => Sum = 11
         /   \                               /   \
     [1]     [3]                        [7]       [9]

   After update:
                              [1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11] => Sum = 37
                             /                     \
               [1, 3, 6] => Sum = 10         [7, 9, 11] => Sum = 27
               /          \                      /           \
        [1, 3] => Sum = 4   [6] => Sum = 6  [7, 9] => Sum = 16   [11] => Sum = 11
         /   \                               /   \
     [1]     [3]                        [7]       [9]

   As you can see, only the affected nodes are updated, making this an efficient
   process.

   Summary:
   --------
   - Segment trees are used to efficiently perform range queries and updates.
   - They allow us to handle queries like sum, min, max, etc., over a range.
   - Time complexity for both updates and queries is O(log n), making segment 
     trees ideal for large arrays.
